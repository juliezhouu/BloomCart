# BloomCart Icons

This folder should contain the extension icons in PNG format:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
1. **Online tools**: Use services like Canva, Figma, or Adobe Express
2. **Design software**: Photoshop, GIMP, or Sketch
3. **Icon generators**: Browser extension icon generators

## Design Guidelines

- Use a plant/flower/leaf theme to match BloomCart's sustainability focus
- Use green colors (#7CB342, #558B2F) to match the brand
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility

## Temporary Solution

For development, you can use emoji-based icons or simple solid color squares. The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default placeholder.

To generate quick placeholder icons:
1. Visit https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
2. Use the emoji "🌸" or "🌱"
3. Download and rename the files as needed
