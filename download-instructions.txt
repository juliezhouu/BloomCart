   - Click the "Download" button
   - Select "Lottie JSON" format
   - Save the file

2. **Add to Your Extension:**
   - Copy the downloaded JSON file to:
     `/Users/juliezhou/BloomCart/extension/assets/animations/plant.json`
   - Replace the current plant.json file with your downloaded animation

3. **Test the Animation:**
   - Reload your Chrome extension
   - Go to any Amazon product page
   - You should see the Lottie plant animation in the bottom right corner
   - The plant will grow/shrink based on product sustainability ratings

4. **Animation Behavior:**
   - Rating A: +10 frames (plant grows more)
   - Rating B: +5 frames (plant grows)
   - Rating C: -5 frames (plant shrinks slightly)
   - Rating D: -10 frames (plant shrinks)
